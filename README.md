# Conditional DCGAN (cDCGAN) for Generating Artwork Conditioned on Film Genres

This repo contains a cDCGAN model that I trained to generate artwork based on different film genres, e.g. cartoon, cyberpunk, horror, noir, western. The cDCGAN model was modified based on the official Pytorch tutorial (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html) and the conditionals (the film genres) were embedded as a final linear layer to the cDCGAN network.

I trained the model on both the CIFAR10 dataset as well as my own novel dataset of digital art scraped from https://www.artstation.com/ using the web-scraper located in https://github.com/hueyning/art-station-scraper.

## Model Results

Some interesting images generated by the model are shown below. To view more image output alongside the model implementation, please refer to the notebook: `EvaluateGan-ArtDataset.ipynb`. The notebook can be set with a different random seed to generate different image samples.
